//1. connect output to print statements to identify secitons of code - talk avbout cause and effect of code 
//- print on whatever line corresponds to that output
//2. focus on a group - chunked - these four actions accomplish ______ (use vocab)
// pick smth that someone has not talked abt , if ppl. chose everyhting can focus on something in one detail or go to unit notes and pick smth out that was not discussed
